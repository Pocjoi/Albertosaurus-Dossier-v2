            <h2>The Poop of 87</h2>
            <p>The details of this attack and the identity of the animatronic responsible are currently unknown, but it
                allegedly caused the victim to lose the frontal lobe of their brain. The victim survived the attack.

                The incident contributed to a loss in the company's reputation, which was one of the numerous incidents
                that resulted in a major drop in business going forward.

                As a result of the incident, the animatronics were no longer allowed to wander around the building
                during the day; the management decided to limit their free-roaming mode to nighttime, so as to "prevent
                their servos from locking up.
