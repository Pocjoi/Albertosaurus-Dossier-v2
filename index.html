            The Albertosaurus thrived in the Late Cretaceous Period, which was nearly 70-74 million years ago. This era
            introduced a variety of dinosaurs into the world, that included the Albertosaurus, although it’s lifespan
            was short lived, it was a ferocious apex predator, easily dominating its ecosystem.

          <h2>Joseph B. Tyrell</h2>
          <p>The Albertosaurus’ remains were first ever discovered by a 25 year old man named, Joseph B. Tyrrell. On
            June 9th of 1884, he was actually on an expedition on the search of coal in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation
            of the Red Deer River in Canada.</p>

          <h2>Life and Behavior</h2>
          <p>The life of the Albertosaurus would be considered a short one, only to have lived to about 14 years or
            older. It was believed by scientists to have had a high mortality rate as they grew older, this was possibly
            due to their high physiological demands in the growing phase. Since their remains have been found within
            close proximity to one another, it was believed that they had what is considered “pack behavior.” They were
            also the apex predator in their entire ecosystem.</p>

          <h2>Fossils and Size</h2>
          <p>The Albertosaurus is noted to be at least 8 to 9 meters in length (26-30 feet). Although their size was
            large in comparison to an average human, they were very agile and speedy. The remains of the Albertosaurus
            have been dated to be nearly 73.1 million years old! They were first discovered in the Horseshoe Canyon
            Formation in 1884.</p>

          <h2>Food and Habitat</h2>
          <p>Being a carnivore, the daily diet of the Albertosaurus consisted mainly of Hadrosaurs and other duck-billed
            dinosaurs.
            They’re incredible bone structure would help aid them in consuming food, especially when it came to
            efficiency The Albertosaurus would primarily prefer to live in lush, heavily vegetated semi-tropical
            environments. Remains having been found in Alberta, Canada in areas that used to be floodplains that
            supported large varieties of life nearly 70 million years ago</p>

          <h2>Species</h2>
          <p>The Albertosaurus Sarcophagus was quite a large tyrannosaur, although smaller than the average T-Rex, was
            still very volatile. While being relatively similar to the T-Rex, the Albertosaurus differed form their
            popular counterpart. They belonged to a subfamily of Albertosaurinae along with the Gorgosaurus.</p>
